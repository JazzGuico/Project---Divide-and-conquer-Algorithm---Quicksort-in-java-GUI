This Java program implements a graphical visualizer for the Quicksort algorithm using Swing, a GUI toolkit in Java. The application introduces users to the divide-and-conquer concept by allowing them to choose a pivot and then watch how the quicksort algorithm recursively sorts an array of numbers.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Main Features:
  GUI Layout
    The program uses a JFrame as the main window titled "Divide and Conquer Algorithm - Quicksort".
    It displays headers, labels, and buttons with aesthetic colors to guide users through the process.

  Interactive Pivot Selection
    • A shuffled array of 7 integers (from 1 to 30) is displayed as clickable buttons.
    • Users select a pivot by clicking any of the number buttons, triggering the visual sorting.
  
  Real-time Quicksort Visualization
    • Once a pivot is chosen, a copy of the array is sorted using a modified quicksort algorithm.
    • The visual representation below the original array shows how elements are rearranged in each recursive step.
  
  Color highlights represent different actions
  🔶 Orange: Current pivot being evaluated.
  🟡 Yellow: Element currently being compared.
  🟢 Green: Elements that were swapped.
  🔴 Red: Final pivot placement.
  🔷 Blue (default): Normal state of other elements.
  
  Threaded Execution
    • SwingWorker is used to handle sorting in a background thread to keep the UI responsive.
    • Sorting steps are animated using Thread.sleep() for clear, gradual transitions.
  
  Visual Update Panels
    • Each value is displayed in a panel beneath the corresponding button.
    • As sorting proceeds, these panels are dynamically updated to reflect the array’s changing state.

Technical Highlights
  • Uses Java Swing components such as JFrame, JLabel, JButton, and JPanel.
  • Implements custom colors and layout for better user experience.
  • Applies clone() on the original array to preserve it across different pivot selections.
  • Makes use of lambda expressions, Streams, and modern Java practices for readability.

Purpose:
  This program is ideal for
    • Students learning sorting algorithms. 
    • Visual learners who benefit from graphical representations.
    • Demonstrations in algorithm or data structure classes.
